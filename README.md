# Financial-Risk-Analysis-Credit-Scoring-Model
Financial risk evaluation and credit scoring model development using classification algorithms, feature engineering, and Tableau dashboard visualization.

## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing financial customer data to predict credit scores and assess financial risk.  
We performed feature engineering, built machine learning models for classification, and developed an interactive Tableau dashboard to visualize credit risk distributions and key indicators.

## Tools Used

- Python (Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib)
- Tableau
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## Key Steps

- Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering
- Handling Missing Values and Categorical Encoding
- Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classification
- Model Evaluation (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, ROC Curve)
- Development of an Interactive Tableau Credit Risk Dashboard

---

## Key Insights

- Random Forest outperformed Logistic Regression with an accuracy of ~78%.
- Good credit scores were more common among customers with fewer delayed payments and lower outstanding debts.
- Inactive customers and those with multiple loans showed higher risk of poor credit ratings.
- Dashboard allows stakeholders to explore credit scores distribution by financial indicators dynamically.
